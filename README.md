### 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Data Scientist** based in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷.  
Currently, I work at **FGV IBRE**, focusing on **Generative AI**, **Machine Learning**, and **Data Engineering** within the **AWS** ecosystem. My work involves building advanced NLP pipelines, developing classification models, and optimizing cloud data processes using **Snowflake** and **Streamlit**.

I hold a **B.Sc. in Computer Science** and have a strong background in automating business processes and BI from my previous experiences at **Bagaggio** and **Enel**.

**Fun fact:** Before diving into data, I was a **professional e-sports player**, a journey that sharpened my resilience, strategic thinking, and ability to perform under high pressure 🎮.

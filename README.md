### 🧠 About Me

I'm a **Data Analyst** from Rio de Janeiro, Brazil 🇧🇷  
Currently working at **Bagaggio**, where I build dashboards, automate workflows, and uncover insights using **Power BI**, **Python**, and **SQL**.

I'm passionate about **data analysis**, **automation**, and on the path toward becoming a **data scientist**, with a practical focus on solving business challenges.

Previously, I worked in **IT Audit** at Enel Brasil.  
Fun fact: I was once a **professional e-sports player** for a North American team — where I developed resilience, sharp communication, and strong analytical skills 🎮.
